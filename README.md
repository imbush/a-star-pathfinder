# a-star-pathfinder
Implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm in pygame.
There are 3 functions under main.py. 

1. terminal_version() allows for manual input of the board from the terminal.

2. manual_version() requires the user to edit the input board, start and end values in main.py.

3. pygame_version() is like manual_version but displays the solution with pygame.
